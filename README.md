## This project includes:

* Next.js, utilizing Next's API routing capabilities
* Routes for ChatGPT and Twilio APIs
* Frontend design with TailwindCSS

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

* Note that you will need to provide your own OpenAI and Twilio API keys in a .env file.

Edit the page by modifying `pages/_app.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Modify the API routes by changing the TypeScript files in the `pages/api` directory. Files in this directory are treated as [routes] instead of React pages.
